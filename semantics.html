        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am an adventurous and open-minded individual with a passion for traveling, experiencing diverse cultures, and trying out new cuisines. In my free time, I find excitement in motorcycle riding, intellectual stimulation in watching and reading, and meaningful connections through making friends. As a teacher, I am dedicated to sharing knowledge and inspiring young minds. My insatiable curiosity drives me to continuously learn, and I am currently pursuing web development to become a frontend developer. Family is of utmost importance to me, and spending time with them brings joy and a sense of belonging to my vibrant life.</p>
